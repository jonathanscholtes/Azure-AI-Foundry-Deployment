## Loading Index Data and Validating

To upload sample documents to the Azure Storage Account and enable embedding creation, you must connect to the VPN as described in the deployment steps.


###  Upload Documents for Indexing with Azure Function  

Upload the JSON documents from the [data](../data) directory to the **load** container in the Azure Storage Account. This upload will trigger the document processing function, which will chunk and index the documents into Azure AI Search.

###  Add Vector Index to Azure AI Foundry

To chat with the vector data stored in **Azure AI Search** using the Playground, you need to add your Azure AI Search index as a data source.

#### 1. **Add Data Source â€“ Azure AI Search Index**
In the Playground, click on **`+ Add a new data source`**.  
   ![add data source](../media/add_data_source.png)

#### 2. **Select AI Search Source Location**
Choose **Azure AI Search** as the data source.

#### 6. **Chat with Azure AI Search Vector Indexes**
With the new data source added, you can now chat with the vector data using the Playground.  
For example, if you uploaded data related to rocket propulsion, you can ask:  
**"What is supersonic combustion?"**
