- ✅ **Azure CLI:** Install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli) for managing Azure resources.  
- ✅ **IDE with Bicep & PowerShell Support:** Use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the **Bicep extension** for development and validation.
