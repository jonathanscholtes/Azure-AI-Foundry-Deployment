# Azure AI Foundry Deployment: Networking, Security, and Model Hosting  

## Overview  

This project implements the **Azure AI Baseline Reference Architecture** to deploy an **Azure AI Foundry** following best practices for networking, security, and model integration. It provisions the infrastructure necessary for chatting over data using managed models such as:  
- **Ada-002** for text embeddings  
- **GPT-4o** for natural language generation  
- **Phi-4** open mulit-model deployed as serverless api  

The solution automates the deployment of **Azure AI Foundry** services, including hubs, projects, and networking components, using **PowerShell** and **Bicep** templates. It also integrates observability through **Log Analytics** and **Application Insights** for monitoring and diagnostics.  


#### Key Features  

- **Azure AI Foundry Deployment:**  
  - Deploys **AI Hub**, **AI Project**, and **AI Services** for model hosting and generative AI solutions.  
  - Uses **private endpoints** and **managed identities** for secure access.  

- **Networking and Security:**  
  - Creates a **VNet** with subnets and a **VPN Gateway** for remote access.  
  - Securlty route and manage traffic with **private endpoints**.  

- **Model Integration:**  
  - Supports **chat over data** with **GPT-4o** and **Phi-4**.  
  - Enables **vector search** and **RAG** with **Azure AI Search**.  

- **Infrastructure as Code:**  
  - Uses **Bicep** and **PowerShell** for automated deployment.  
  - Ensures modular, reusable templates.

## Usage

### Requirements  
- **Azure Subscription:** Ensure you have an active Azure subscription with sufficient privileges to create and manage resources.  
- **Azure CLI:** Install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli) for managing Azure resources.  
- **IDE with Bicep, PowerShell Support:** Use an IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the **Bicep extension** for development and validation.  



### Deployment Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository  
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonathanscholtes/azure-ai-search-large-doc-indexing-vectorization.git
cd azure-ai-search-large-doc-indexing-vectorization
```


#### 2. Deploy the Solution  
Navigate to the infrastructure directory:

```bash
cd infra
```

Run the following PowerShell command to deploy the solution. Replace the placeholders with your actual subscription name and Azure region. The `-DeployVpnGateway` flag is optional for deploying the Azure VPN Gateway:

```powershell
.\deploy.ps1 -Subscription '[Subscription Name]' -Location 'eastus2'
```

‚úÖ This script provisions all required Azure resources based on the specified parameters. The deployment may take up to **40 minutes** to complete.


#### 3. Download the VPN Client  (Optional)
Once the deployment is complete, follow these steps to download the VPN client:  
- Go to the **Azure Portal** ‚Üí **Virtual Network Gateway** ‚Üí **Point-to-Site Configuration**.  
- Click **Download VPN Client**.  
- Install the client on your local machine to securely connect to the Azure environment.
