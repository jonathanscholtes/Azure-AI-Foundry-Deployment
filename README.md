# Azure AI Foundry Deployment: Networking, Security, and Model Hosting  

## Overview  

This project implements the **Azure AI Baseline Reference Architecture** to deploy an **Azure AI Foundry** following best practices for networking, security, and model integration. It provisions the infrastructure necessary for chatting over data using managed models such as:  
- **Ada-002** for text embeddings  
- **GPT-4o** for natural language generation  
- **Phi-4** open mulit-model deployed as serverless api  


The solution automates the deployment of **Azure AI Foundry**, including AI Hubs, AI Projects, and networking components, using **PowerShell** and **Bicep** templates. It incorporates observability through **Log Analytics**  and **Application Insights** for real-time monitoring and diagnostics. Additionally, it integrates **Azure Functions** with Blob Triggers for event-driven processing of JSON documents, chunking document text, extracing meta data, generating vector embeddings with the Ada-002 model, and indexing  into **Azure AI Search** to enable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and semantic search that will be tested using the PlayGround.

#### Key Features  

- **Azure AI Foundry Deployment:**  
  - Deploys **AI Hub**, **AI Project**, and **AI Services** for model hosting with secure access via **private endpoints** and **managed identities**.  

- **Networking and Security:**  
  - Creates a **VNet** with subnets, a **VPN Gateway** for remote access, and **private endpoints** for secure communication.  

- **Model Integration:**  
  - Enables **chat over data** with **GPT-4o** and **Phi-4**.  
  - Supports **vector search** and **RAG** with **Azure AI Search**.  
  - Generates **Ada-002** vector embeddings from JSON documents.  

- **Vector Processing Pipeline:**  
  - Uses **Azure Blob Storage** triggers to process new JSON files with **Azure Functions**.  
  - Extracts content, generates **Ada-002** embeddings, and indexes them in **Azure AI Search** for semantic retrieval and **RAG**.  

- **Infrastructure as Code:**  
  - Automates deployment with **Bicep** and **PowerShell** using modular, reusable templates.
